## More about the event:

> _What could a letter express that a word, a look or even silence would not express a thousand times better?_

Ledra Music Soloists, on the initiative of actress Mara Constantinou and her theatrical group Dream Theatre Productions, present a complex and unique musical-theatrical performance entitled Female Ink. The show recalls a lost era and dives into the depths of the female soul. Passion demands paper; women write, narrating of the bottomless depth of love, communication and eros. Thirteen real women, distinguished personalities no longer with us, speak, laying out their souls effortlessly and naked with the flowing written word, connected, both with the rhythms and vibrations of the body, as well as with sexuality. Through the letters, the heroine of the show travels in time and brings yesterday to life. She awakens images and sounds, like a game, bringing to the stage the yesterday to the today and the today to the yesterday. Impulsiveness has the first say and draws the viewer into the minds of these great women of the last century. Indelible over the years, these women transport humanity and culture to other levels. Dynamic and different for their time, they left behind food for thought and an invaluable corpora. Music plays a major role, expressing that which cannot be said in words. Female Ink will tickle the senses. It extends an invitation to see tomorrow from a different angle. It invites one to believe again, in the true communication between people, in the power of expression and in real love, which nowadays, unfortunately, is on a respirator, facing extinction. Six virtuosi meet the heroine, and together they bring to life an era when big cities were a magical jazz greenhouse, with music as a multipurpose outlet, as a lever for upheaval – social and personal. Excerpts from the letters of Simone de Beauvoir, Isadora Duncan, Maria Callas, Virginia Woolf, Maria Polydouri, Anaïs Nin, Penelope Delta, Frida Kahlo will be heard.

_Love can be expressed in a myriad of different ways,_

_but the most priceless and precious will always be the classic love letter._
